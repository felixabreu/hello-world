It's not Computer Science if it doesn't begin with a hello world!

My name is Felix Abreu and I am currently a senior majoring in Computer Science at the University at Albany. 
My passion for technology began as a young teen. In a family of eleven siblings including myself, I was the one assigned 
to troubleshooting our home computer whenever it had any issues. Although I was not 100% aware of what I was doing when I would
troubleshoot, I started getting more familiar with computers and the terminology in the technology field. Eleven years later, I'm on the verge of graduating with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science! Stay focused and always remind yourself of the end goal!

Regards,

Felix Abreu
